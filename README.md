# 👋 Welcome 👋

🔭 I’m currently working on a data science project analysing the impact of game genres on game success.
- Research question: *"Is genre a statistically significant factor in predicting game success?"*
- Current focus: building ETL pipelines and a reproducible environment with Docker Compose.
- Goal: produce statistical reports and predictive models to identify trends in the gaming industry.

🌱 I’m developing skills in data engineering, particularly in designing and deploying automated ETL workflows.

### 🤝 I’m open to collaboration on data-driven projects, especially those involving analytics, statistical modelling, and predictive systems.


## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Languages: Python, SQL, C#

- Data Science Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels

- Visualisation: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

- Databases: PostgreSQL

- Pipelines & Orchestration: Docker, Docker Compose, Prefect

## 🌟 Achievements

  - **Boot.dev Hackathon 2025** – Built a game (*Screaming Pussies*) with a friend in one weekend. While we didn’t win a prize, we received an *honourable mention* 🎉 → [Read more](https://blog.boot.dev/news/hackathon-2025/)  
   > The game is about controlling a little cat, lost in a maze, with your voice. We experimented with frequency analysis and had a lot of fun building it.  

- **Boot.dev Back-End Developer Path** – Helped me deepen my understanding of computer science and sharpen my ability to deploy models and pipelines efficiently.
- **DataCamp Data Science Certification** – My first step toward professional data proficiency.  
- **Master’s Degree** – Completed with a thesis on *Social Memory*.
